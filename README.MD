# First Challange Project

## Changes have been applied in this Project

There are many changes have been made in this challenge, I would like to briefly summarize the changes as follows:

- For a web page to meet accessibility standards
  I was able to view the source code

- I can view the structure of the HTML elements
  and I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- When I view icon and image elements
  I made it possible to access accessible sub-attributes

- I created a short and descriptive title.
